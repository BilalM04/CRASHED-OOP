## Overview

CRASHED! is a simple yet engaging project that allows players to navigate a car through a dynamic environment filled with obstacles. The game is not just about dodging cars; it's also a showcase of how object-oriented design principles can be applied to create modular and scalable code.

## Features

- **p5.js Integration:** The game leverages the capabilities of p5.js, a JavaScript library for creative coding and visualization. This makes it easy to handle graphics and user interactions.

- **Object-Oriented Design:** The code is organized using object-oriented principles, emphasizing inheritance and polymorphism. This design approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and scalability.

- **Dynamic Environment:** Experience a dynamic gaming environment where obstacles move and present challenges for the player. The game showcases how object-oriented concepts can be applied to create interactive and responsive simulations.

## How to Play

1. **Controls:**
   - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the movement of your car.
   - Navigate through the moving obstacles to score points.

2. **Scoring:**
   - Earn points for every successful dodge.
   - Be cautious! Colliding with an obstacle will result in a game over.

3. **Objective:**
   - See how long you can survive and how high you can score by dodging obstacles.
